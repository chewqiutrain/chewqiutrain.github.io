# Metadata 
## Favicon
1. Copy `public/favicon.ico` to `/app/icon.png` 
1. Each `page.tsx` will inherit parent's metadata unless there is a one defined for that page

# Trying out something new
Done:
1. I figured out how to do a table, roughly. It doesn't look pretty for sure.

Risks:
1. CSS is painful.
1. Does it make sense to wireframe stuff first? Or am I using that as a distraction?
1. Does the data model even make sense? At lowest granularity, it would be location(city)-activity-hours?
    - How to make composites? 
    - Does target user group make sense? 
    - Seems like might need to categorise activities or tag them?

Thouhts:
1. The idea is probably crap but I need the practice

Next goals (These aren't well thought through, but the practice seems relevant):
1. Create mock data in code, display in table. 
1. Allow filter on table.
1. Create itinerary page
1. Allow selection of items on table to build itinerary.
