# Error handling
2 methods
1. `error.tsx` in the same location as `page.tsx`. Catch-all for all child routes to display fallback UI.
    - Must be a client component 
    - Take 2 props 
        - `error` subclass of JS native `Error`
        - `reset` function which will try to re-render the route segment 
1. Using React's `notFound` function. For more targeted handling to show 404. Takes precendence over `error.tsx`.
    - Combine this with `not-found.tsx`


# Form validation
## Client side
In an `input` element, add `required`. Leverages assistive technologies support of browser validation

## Server side
Pros
- Ensure data is in expected format before writing to database
- Reduce risk of malicious users by-passing client side validation
- SSOT for what is considered valid data 

# Auth
What's going on here... 
```js
<form action={async () => {
            'use server';
            await signOut();
          }
        }>
```
