# On Work
1. Guided a junior to implement SSO using AzureAD. Had to move away from proposed oauth2-proxy. 
1. Taught a DS to spin up FE/BE so they aren't reliant on me to debug
1. Trying to enforce rebase + linear history
1. Trying to set up a release process + version tracking for better client comms 
1. Onboarding client FE and DE. 
1. Need to get DSes to commit DQ checks into dbt so we flag data issues early
1. No idea how we're gonna refactor dbt python on snowflake 
1. E2E data masking? 
1. Need to again enforce definition of done to get folks to own their work.


# On app
1. Played with some CSS today. Can't figure out why some `w-x` or `h-x` doesn't work for some x. 
1. Played with `useState`
1. Need to learn redux
1. Really need to keep up with this project to break the chains.
